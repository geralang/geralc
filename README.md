# `gerac`
*The compiler for [the Gera programming language](https://github.com/geralang).*

The Gera compiler is not intended to be used on its own. It is recommended to put `gerac` into the PATH and use `gerap` (the Gera package manager) to build / run code.

## The Future of Gera

Currently, there are a few bugs remaining, which will be fixed in the near future. As of now there is no documentation yet either, which shall be added soon as well.
