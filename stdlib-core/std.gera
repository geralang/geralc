The language that's simple
but not a pain
Does not have classes?
Oh what a shame...

With pretty syntax
that's easy to read
and only few keywords
It's all that you need

Types are not written
The context knows them
Loops are forbidden
Iterators replaced them

Garbage collected
to make your life easy
From null you're protected
and from going crazy"
}
